totra
=====
*an unofficial TopTracker CLI helper*

Purpose
-------

[TopTracker](https://www.toptal.com/tracker) is great time tracking tool, but when
it comes to making polls, reports etc. I find CLI tools much more productive then
clicking around web page.

The idea went from simple question: *how much hours I've worked i.e this week ?*

With TopTracker web page, to know such information I had to: login to web page, click on 
date range, export activities to csv, open spreadsheet software and import this csv,
 and then sum.
With this tool I can just:

`totra how_much_hours --workers="Andrzej Barga≈Ñski" --from=Monday -l my@login.com -p mypassword`

...and in second you see result !  

Usage
-----
__*Notice:*__
*Application is still in planning stage. Commands, options etc. can change, and every* 
*TopTracker user is invited to post thoughts, wishes and participate in development.*
